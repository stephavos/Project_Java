Bilans personnels du groupe 12 :


Alexandre Winstel :his project was pretty hard, but not impossible, unfortunately we didn't had the required skills and communication to complete the task until the end, but overall, it was a good project.

Jules Bricot : For me, this project was very dense and hard. We had a lot of difficulties to communicate as a group. 
I still found this project very interesting even though we didn't have time to do everything we wanted to do in the first place.
